[[def: Witness]]

~ a _witness_ is an _entity_ or _component_ designated (trusted) by the _controller_ of an _identifier_. The primary role of a witness is to verify, sign, and keep events associated with an identifier. A _witness_ is the _controller_ of its own self-referential _identifier_ which may or may not be the same as the _identifier_ to which it is a _witness_. See Annex A under KAWA (KERI's Algorithm for Witness Agreement).
