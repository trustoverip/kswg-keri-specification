[[def: Key-State]]

~ a set of authoritative keys for an AID along with other essential information necessary to establish, evolve, verify, and validate control-signing authority for that AID. This information includes the current public keys and their thresholds (for a multi-signature scheme); pre-rotated key digests and their thresholds; [[ref: witness]]es and their thresholds; and configurations. An AID’s key state is first established through its [[ref:inception event]] and may evolve via subsequent [[ref: rotation event]]s. Thus, an AID’s key state is time-dependent.
